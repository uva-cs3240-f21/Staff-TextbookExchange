# Staff-TextbookExchange

__This example is being depricated!__

We are moving away from using Travis-CI and over to using GitHub Actions for continuous integration.  We are leaving this repo here, as it still shows the base of what a Django app should look like.  However, you should search the class organization for repos starting with "Staff-" to see updated examples.
